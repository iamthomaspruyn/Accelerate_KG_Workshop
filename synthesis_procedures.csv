FeCl3·6H2O (2.5 mmol), DABCO (7.5 mmol), H3PO4 (7.5 mmol), n-butanol (3 cm³), and water (7 cm³) were reacted. The reaction mixture was heated at 180 °C for 3 days. The mixture was then slowly cooled at a rate of 10 °C per hour to room temperature. The product, [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6], was obtained as colorless crystals. The colorless crystals were manually separated from a small amount of green material to obtain pure compound 1.",The synthesis was performed under autogenous pressure.,"The synthesis was carried out in a Teflon-lined acid digestion bomb (23 cm³) under autogenous pressure. The reaction of FeCl3·6H2O (2.5 mmol), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) (7.5 mmol), H3PO4 (7.5 mmol), n-butanol (3 cm³) and water (7 cm³) at 180 °C for 3 d followed by slow cooling at 10 °C h⁻¹ to room temperature produced [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] 1 as colourless crystals and a small amount of a green material."
